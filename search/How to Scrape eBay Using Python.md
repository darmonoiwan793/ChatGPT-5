Create a Python project named `ebay-scraper` and initialize it in your preferred editor.

### Install Required Libraries

Install the following Python libraries for scraping and data processing:

- **Requests**: To send HTTP requests and retrieve HTML content.
- **BeautifulSoup**: To parse and extract data from HTML.
- **Pandas**: To structure data into DataFrames and export to CSV.

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas
```

## Scraping an eBay Product Page

A product page on eBay contains critical data such as the product title, price, description, shipping cost, and reviews. Letâ€™s extract this data step-by-step.

### Analyze the Product Page Structure

Open an eBay product page (e.g., [this MacBook listing](https://www.ebay.com/itm/404316395828)) and use your browserâ€™s developer tools to inspect the HTML elements. Identify the CSS selectors for the data you want to scrape, such as:

- **Product Title**: Found in the `<h1>` tag with a specific class.
- **Price**: Located in a `<div>` tag with a class like `x-price-primary`.
- **Shipping Cost**: Found in a `<span>` tag within a parent container.

### Write the Code to Scrape Data

Hereâ€™s an example script to scrape an eBay product page:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Define the URL of the eBay product page
url = "https://www.ebay.com/itm/404316395828"

# Send an HTTP request to fetch the HTML content
response = requests.get(url, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")

# Extract product details
title = soup.select_one(".x-item-title__mainTitle .ux-textspans--BOLD").text.strip()
price = soup.select_one(".x-price-primary .ux-textspans").text.strip()
shipping_cost = soup.select_one(".ux-labels-values--shipping .ux-textspans--BOLD").text.strip()

# Print the extracted data
print(f"Title: {title}")
print(f"Price: {price}")
print(f"Shipping Cost: {shipping_cost}")
```

## Scraping eBay Search Results

### Understand the Search Page URL Structure

When you search for a keyword on eBay, the URL contains parameters defining your search query. For example:

```plaintext
https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=macbook&_sacat=0&_pgn=1
```

Key parameters:
- `_nkw`: Search keyword (e.g., `macbook`).
- `_pgn`: Page number for pagination.

### Handle Pagination

To scrape multiple pages of search results, iterate through the pages using a loop and increment the `_pgn` parameter until there are no more pages.

Hereâ€™s a script to scrape eBay search results with pagination:

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

# Define the base search URL
base_url = "https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html"

# Initialize an empty list to store product data
products = []

# Loop through multiple pages
for page in range(1, 6):  # Scrape the first 5 pages
    params = {
        "_nkw": "macbook",
        "_sacat": "0",
        "_pgn": page
    }
    response = requests.get(base_url, params=params, headers={"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"})
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "html.parser")
    
    # Extract product details from each listing
    for item in soup.select(".s-item"):
        title = item.select_one(".s-item__title").text if item.select_one(".s-item__title") else "N/A"
        price = item.select_one(".s-item__price").text if item.select_one(".s-item__price") else "N/A"
        shipping = item.select_one(".s-item__logisticsCost").text if item.select_one(".s-item__logisticsCost") else "N/A"
        products.append({"Title": title, "Price": price, "Shipping": shipping})
    
    print(f"Scraped page {page}")

# Save the data to a CSV file
df = pd.DataFrame(products)
df.to_csv("ebay_search_results.csv", index=False)
print("Data saved to ebay_search_results.csv")
```
