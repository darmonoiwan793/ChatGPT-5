## How Many Results Can You Scrape?

Fast Google Scraper can extract **200–300 results per search query** on average. This limitation is due to Google’s design, which restricts the number of results displayed. Although Google claims millions of results for a query, only a maximum of three pages (100 results per page) are displayed.

### Tips to Maximize Results:

1. Use variations of keywords to gather more comprehensive data.  
2. Run test scrapes with small datasets to estimate resources required.
