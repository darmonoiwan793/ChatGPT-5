Scraping Google Shopping can unlock several benefits:

- **Price Monitoring**: Compare prices from multiple sellers to find the best deals and monitor market trends.

## **Understanding the Structure of Google Shopping Results**

Before scraping, itâ€™s essential to understand how Google Shopping organizes its data. A typical search page contains:

1. **Products List**: Displays products from various retailers relevant to your search query.
2. **Filters**: Allows users to refine search results by color, size, rating, etc.
3. **Sorting Options**: Sorts products based on price, ratings, and other criteria.

Each product listing includes details such as the product title, price, ratings, reviews, and seller information. These are the key data points we aim to extract.

## **Scraping Google Shopping Results with Python**

Hereâ€™s the Python code to scrape Google Shopping results using ScraperAPI.

### **Step 3: Extract Data from Google Shopping**

The following code fetches shopping results using ScraperAPIâ€™s Google Shopping endpoint:

```python
import requests
import json

# Replace with your ScraperAPI key
API_KEY = 'SCRAPE9837861'

# Define your payload
payload = {
    'api_key': API_KEY,
    'query': 'nike+shoes',
    'country': 'us'
}

# API URL
url = 'https://api.scraperapi.com/google_shopping'

# Make the GET request
response = requests.get(url, params=payload)
data = response.json()

# Print the JSON response
print(json.dumps(data, indent=2))
```

This will return the Google Shopping results for the query "nike shoes." The response includes product titles, prices, ratings, and other data points.

### **Step 4: Export Data to a CSV File**

To make the data actionable, letâ€™s export it to a CSV file. The following code extracts product titles, prices, ratings, and sources from the response and saves them in a CSV file.

```python
import requests
import csv

# Replace with your ScraperAPI key
API_KEY = 'SCRAPE9837861'

# Define your payload
payload = {
    'api_key': API_KEY,
    'query': 'nike+shoes',
    'country': 'us'
}

# API URL
url = 'https://api.scraperapi.com/google_shopping'

# Make the GET request
response = requests.get(url, params=payload)
data = response.json()

# Open a CSV file to write the data
with open('shopping_results.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

    # Write the headers
    csv_writer.writerow(["Title", "Pricing", "Rating", "Source"])

    # Write the data
    for result in data["shopping_results"]:
        csv_writer.writerow([result["title"], result["price"], result["rating"], result["source"]])

print('Shopping results saved to shopping_results.csv')
```

### **Output**

Running this script will generate a file named `shopping_results.csv` with the following structure:

| Title                  | Pricing  | Rating | Source       |
|------------------------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Nike Running Shoes     | $79.99   | 4.5    | retailer.com |
