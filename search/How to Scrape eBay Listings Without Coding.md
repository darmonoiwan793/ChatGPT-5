## Scraping eBay Listings with eBay API

eBay provides a range of APIs to facilitate data collection, divided into categories such as Buy, Sell, and Commerce. While these APIs offer powerful tools, they come with restrictions, including:

- **API Call Limits**: For example, the Inventory API under Sell APIs allows up to 2 million daily calls.  
- **Data Filtering**: Some listing details are filtered to protect seller privacy.  
- **Coding Expertise**: API integration requires technical skills, which may not be ideal for non-developers.

### Alternative: Web Scraping Tools

For users without coding knowledge, web scraping tools provide a simpler, more flexible alternative. These tools can bypass restrictions, extract the full HTML of listing pages, and offer a more user-friendly experience.
