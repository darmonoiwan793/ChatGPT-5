## Why Scrape Walmart Product Reviews?

Scraping Walmart reviews enables businesses to build a historical dataset that can help improve marketing strategies and make data-driven decisions. Use cases include:

- **Customer Sentiment Analysis**: Understand what users like or dislike about specific products.  
- **Competitive Research**: Gain insights into the performance of competing products.  

To achieve scalability, we'll use ScraperAPIâ€™s **Async Scraper Service**, which automates critical processes like:

- Concurrency management  
- Retry logic  
- Bypassing anti-bot detections

## Scraping Walmart Product Reviews in Node.js

### Architecture Overview

To scrape Walmart reviews at scale, we'll develop two scripts:

1. **URL Generator Script**: Prepares a list of review pages and sends them to ScraperAPI's Async Scraper.  
2. **Webhook Server**: Receives responses from ScraperAPI, processes the HTML, and saves the extracted reviews in JSON format.

### Using ScraperAPIâ€™s Walmart Product Endpoint

ScraperAPI provides an easy-to-use Walmart Products endpoint to directly extract reviews in JSON format.

```plaintext
https://api.scraperapi.com/structured/walmart/product
```

You simply send requests to this endpoint with your API key and the product ID in the payload. The response includes a `reviews` key containing structured data.

#### Example JSON Response

```json
"reviews": [
    {
        "title": "Walmart pickup order",
        "text": "Make sure they scan your item right I received my order thru the delivery but when I finished activating my phone it still says SOS mode only...",
        "author": "TrustedCusto",
        "date_published": "2/8/2024",
        "rating": 5
    },
    {
        "title": "Very satisfied.",
        "text": "I'm very satisfied with my purchase and product. Thank you. Definitely will recommend when I get the chance.",
        "author": "BLVCKSNVCK",
        "date_published": "10/7/2023",
        "rating": 5
    }
]
```

### 3. Setting Up the Project

#### Initialize Your Node.js Project

```bash
mkdir walmart-scraper
cd walmart-scraper
npm init -y
```

---

### 4. Generate Review URLs

Create a script to generate URLs for review pages.

#### Example Code

```javascript
const generateReviewURLs = (baseURL, totalPages) => {
    const urls = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= totalPages; i++) {
        urls.push(`${baseURL}?page=${i}`);
    }
    return urls;
};

const reviewURLs = generateReviewURLs(
    'https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/123456789',
    48
);
console.log(reviewURLs);
```

---

### 5. Scrape Reviews with Async Scraper

Send generated URLs to ScraperAPIâ€™s Async Scraper. It manages IP rotation, CAPTCHA solving, and rate limits behind the scenes.

#### Example Async Scraper Code

```javascript
const axios = require('axios');

const apiKey = 'SCRAPE9837861'; // Replace with your ScraperAPI key
const apiUrl = 'https://async.scraperapi.com/batchjobs';
const callbackUrl = 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL'; // Replace with your webhook URL

const sendURLsToScraper = async (urls) => {
    const payload = {
        apiKey,
        urls,
        callback: {
            type: 'webhook',
            url: callbackUrl,
        },
    };

    try {
        const response = await axios.post(apiUrl, payload);
        console.log('ScraperAPI Response:', response.data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error sending URLs:', error);
    }
};

// Example usage
const urls = ['https://www.walmart.com/reviews/product/123456789?page=1'];
sendURLsToScraper(urls);
```

---

### 6. Setting Up a Webhook Server

The webhook server receives responses from ScraperAPI. It processes raw HTML and saves reviews in JSON format.

#### Example Webhook Server Code

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');

const app = express();
const PORT = 5001;

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/reviews', (req, res) => {
    const reviews = req.body.reviews || [];
    fs.appendFileSync('reviews.json', JSON.stringify(reviews, null, 2));
    console.log('Received reviews:', reviews.length);
    res.sendStatus(200);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Webhook server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

---

### 7. Test the Implementation

1. Launch the webhook server: `node webhook-server.js`  
2. Send a request to ScraperAPI: `node send-urls.js`  
3. View the results in `reviews.json`.  

---

## Tips for Scaling Your Walmart Scraper

1. **Break Down Queries**: Use variations of keywords or filter by categories.  
2. **Monitor Results**: Scraping behavior may vary with different products or locations.  
3. **Optimize Data Processing**: Use message brokers for asynchronous data storage at scale.
