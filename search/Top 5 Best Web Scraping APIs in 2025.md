## What Is a Web Scraping API?

A web scraping API enables developers to fetch web page content programmatically. These APIs simplify the scraping process by handling complex tasks like JavaScript rendering, proxy management, and bypassing anti-scraping measures.

For example, using ScraperAPI, you can scrape a webpage like this:

```plaintext
https://api.scraperapi.com?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&url=https://example.com
```

The API processes the request, handles JavaScript rendering, bypasses CAPTCHAs, and returns the scraped data in a structured format.
