# How to Build a Web Crawler in Python: A Step-by-Step Guide

Web crawling with Python is a powerful technique that combines web scraping with the ability to explore unknown links and discover new data sources. In this tutorial, we'll walk through how to build a Python-based web crawler, explore its components, and even work with advanced features like handling JavaScript-rendered websites.

## **What is Web Crawling in Web Scraping?**

### Crawling vs. Scraping

Crawling is a type of web scraping with exploration capabilities. While web scraping usually targets specific URLs with predefined rules, crawling explores new links on a website, finding and scraping data from unknown pages.

- **Web Scraping**: Focused tasks, such as scraping product pages from an e-commerce site.
- **Web Crawling**: Broader tasks, such as discovering and scraping all product pages from a site.

### Use Cases of Web Crawling
1. **Indexing**: Creating search engines and directories.
2. **Broad Scraping**: Scraping multiple websites with the same script.

### Why Not Crawl Everything?
Web crawling is more resource-intensive and complex due to challenges like avoiding duplicates, handling spam, and navigating dynamic content.

## **Setting Up Your Python Crawler**

### Required Python Libraries

To build a Python web crawler, youâ€™ll need the following packages:

1. **httpx**: A modern HTTP client.
2. **parsel**: For parsing HTML using XPath or CSS selectors.
3. **w3lib**: For processing and cleaning URLs.
4. **tldextract**: For extracting domain information.
5. **loguru**: For structured logging.
6. **asyncio**: To run the crawler asynchronously and increase speed.

Install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install httpx parsel w3lib tldextract loguru
```

## **Components of a Web Crawler**

A web crawler consists of several components, such as:

### 1. **URL Discovery and Filtering**
A crawler starts with a list of URLs (seed URLs) and discovers new URLs by parsing web pages. Filters are applied to:
- Remove duplicates.
- Exclude invalid or offsite URLs.
- Avoid certain file types (e.g., images, PDFs).

### 2. **HTML Parsing**
Using `parsel`, extract all hyperlinks (`<a>` tags) from HTML pages. Example:

```python
from parsel import Selector
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def extract_urls(response):
    tree = Selector(response.text)
    return [urljoin(response.url, url.strip()) for url in tree.css("a::attr(href)").getall()]
```

### 3. **Filtering URLs**
Using `w3lib` and `tldextract`, filter valid URLs:

```python
from w3lib.url import canonicalize_url

def is_valid_url(url, domain):
    return domain in url and canonicalize_url(url) not in seen_urls
```

### 4. **Crawl Loop**
The crawler continuously fetches pages, parses them, and discovers new URLs until all targets are processed or a set limit is reached.

## **Building Your Python Crawler**

### Code Example: Basic Python Web Crawler

```python
import httpx
import asyncio
from parsel import Selector
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# Extract URLs from HTML
def extract_urls(response):
    tree = Selector(response.text)
    return [urljoin(response.url, url.strip()) for url in tree.css("a::attr(href)").getall()]

# Async Crawl Loop
async def crawl(urls, domain):
    seen_urls = set()
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        while urls:
            tasks = [client.get(url) for url in urls]
            responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
            new_urls = []
            for response in responses:
                if isinstance(response, httpx.Response):
                    urls = extract_urls(response)
                    new_urls.extend(url for url in urls if domain in url and url not in seen_urls)
                    seen_urls.update(new_urls)
            urls = new_urls

# Start crawling
asyncio.run(crawl(["https://example.com"], "example.com"))
```

## **Advanced Crawling: Dynamic Websites and JavaScript**

For highly dynamic pages, use tools like headless browsers (e.g., Selenium or Playwright) or APIs like ScraperAPI.

### Using ScraperAPI for Dynamic Content
ScraperAPI handles JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHAs, and proxies. Install their SDK and integrate it into your crawler:

```bash
pip install scraperapi-sdk
```

Replace `httpx` with ScraperAPI for seamless integration.

## **Example Project: Crawling Shopify Websites**

Shopify-powered websites often use consistent URL structures. For instance:
- Product pages contain `/products/`.
- Collection pages contain `/collections/`.

### Parsing Shopify Product Data
Shopify stores often embed product details as JSON in `<script>` tags:

```python
from parsel import Selector
import json

def extract_product_data(response):
    tree = Selector(response.text)
    scripts = tree.css("script::text").getall()
    for script in scripts:
        try:
            data = json.loads(script)
            if "price" in data:
                return data
        except json.JSONDecodeError:
            pass
```

Integrate this into your crawler to extract product data dynamically.

## **Power-Up with ScrapFly**

ScrapFly is an advanced scraping API that simplifies crawling. It includes JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHA bypass, and anti-blocking features. You can replace your HTTP client with ScrapFly for seamless integration:

```bash
pip install scrapfly-sdk
```

Enable features like JavaScript rendering with minimal code changes.

## **FAQ**

### Whatâ€™s the difference between scraping and crawling?
Scraping targets specific pages, while crawling explores links to discover new pages for scraping.

### Can I crawl JavaScript-heavy websites?
Yes! Use tools like Playwright or APIs like ScrapFly with JavaScript rendering.

### How can I speed up my crawler?
Use asynchronous programming with `asyncio` to handle multiple requests simultaneously, reducing idle time.

## **Final Thoughts**

Python web crawlers are incredibly versatile tools for data collection. With the ability to explore links dynamically, theyâ€™re ideal for broad-spectrum scraping. By incorporating advanced tools like ScraperAPI and ScrapFly, you can easily overcome challenges like JavaScript rendering and anti-bot mechanisms.
